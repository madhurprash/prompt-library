  <instructions>
    Please analyze this academic paper using the Feynman Technique. Follow these four steps systematically:

    <reading_time_estimate>
      First, estimate the reading time for the original paper based on:
      - Word count and page length
      - Subject matter complexity (basic, intermediate, advanced, highly technical)
      - Number of tables, diagrams, equations, and figures
      - Dense mathematical content or specialized terminology
      Provide your estimate in minutes for a thorough understanding.
    </reading_time_estimate>

    <step_1_identify>
      Identify and explain the core concept of this paper as if teaching it to someone with no background in the field. Use simple language and avoid jargon. What problem is being solved and why does it matter?
    </step_1_identify>

    <step_2_teach>
      Explain the paper's main contribution and methodology in plain English, as if teaching an intelligent 12-year-old. Break down:
      - The key innovation or finding
      - How the authors achieved their results
      - The experimental setup or theoretical framework
      Use analogies and real-world examples where possible.
    </step_2_teach>

    <step_3_identify_gaps>
      Identify gaps in understanding by answering:
      - What assumptions does the paper make that aren't fully explained?
      - Which technical details are glossed over or unclear?
      - What background knowledge is assumed but not provided?
      - Are there logical jumps in the argumentation?
      - What questions remain unanswered after reading the paper?
    </step_3_identify_gaps>

    <step_4_simplify>
      Reorganize and simplify the entire paper into:
      1. A one-paragraph executive summary (max 100 words)
      2. Three key takeaways in bullet points
      3. One simple diagram description (describe what a diagram would show)
      4. An analogy that captures the essence of the work
      5. The "so what?" - why this matters in the real world
    </step_4_simplify>

    <critical_analysis>
      Additionally, provide:
      - Strengths of the paper (2-3 points)
      - Weaknesses or limitations (2-3 points)
      - How this work relates to the broader field
      - Potential follow-up questions or research directions
    </critical_analysis>

    <technical_deep_dive>
      For completeness, also explain:
      - Key equations or algorithms (simplified)
      - Critical experimental results and what they mean
      - Statistical significance and validation methods used
      - How robust the conclusions are given the evidence
    </technical_deep_dive>

  <output_format>
    Structure your response with clear headers for each section. Use markdown formatting.
    Always include the original paper URL at the beginning of your analysis for easy reference.
    
    Include a "Reading Time Analysis" section that shows:
    - Estimated time to read original paper thoroughly
    - Estimated time to read this analysis
    - Time savings achieved (e.g., "This analysis saves you ~45 minutes (10x time reduction)")
    
    Prioritize clarity over completeness - it's better to deeply understand the core concepts than to superficially cover everything.
    Provide only the analysis output that can be directly copied and pasted or checked into a code repository. Do not add any preamble, epilogue, or extra commentary outside the structured analysis.
