      Create a detailed weekly execution schedule with specific limit orders:
      
      Week 1:
      - SELL orders: Stock symbol, shares to sell, recommended limit price (e.g., "SELL 20 shares NVDA at limit $175+")
      - BUY orders: Stock symbol, shares to buy, recommended limit price (e.g., "BUY 15 shares XLV at limit $130 or below")
      
      Week 2-4:
      - Continue rebalancing with specific limit orders
      - Include entry and exit price targets
      - Stagger large positions over multiple weeks to reduce market impact

      - Portfolio rebalancing steps in order of priority
      - Risk management actions if needed
      - For new sector exposure: If recommending sectors not currently in portfolio, suggest either:
        * Relevant S&P sector ETF (e.g., XLE for energy, XLV for healthcare, XLI for industrials, XLRE for real estate)
        * Specific best-in-class stock if there's a clear winner (e.g., UNH for healthcare, XOM for energy, PLD for real estate)

      **Medium-term Strategy (3-12 Months):**

      - Cash buffer and liquidity requirements
    </actionable_implementation_plan>

    <critical_reflection_and_validation>
      **Before finalizing recommendations, perform this critical reflection:**

      **Best-in-Class Validation:**
      For each BUY recommendation, ask:
      - Is this truly the best option in its sector/category for the investor's goals?
      - Are there better alternatives with superior fundamentals, valuation, or growth prospects?
      - Does this choice align with the specific investment timeline and risk tolerance?

      **Sector/ETF Selection Review:**
      For each recommended ETF or sector play:
      - Is this the optimal ETF for exposure to this sector? (Compare expense ratios, holdings, performance)
      - For dividend ETFs: Compare SCHD, VYM, VIG, NOBL - which is best for this investor's income needs?
      - For sector ETFs: Are we recommending XLV, XLI, XLE, XLF, etc. or are there better sector options?
      - For broad market: Is VOO, VTI, SPY, or IVV most appropriate?

      **Hold vs Sell Decision Challenge:**
      For each HOLD recommendation:
      - Is holding truly optimal or are we being too conservative?
      - Would this position be better replaced with a higher-conviction opportunity?
      - Is the position size appropriate for the conviction level?

      **Sell Recommendation Validation:**
      For each SELL recommendation:
      - Are we selling for the right reasons (valuation, allocation, or fundamental deterioration)?
      - Is the timing appropriate given market conditions and tax implications?
      - Are we being too hasty or appropriately decisive?

      **Alternative Consideration:**
      For each recommendation, briefly consider:
      - What alternative stocks/ETFs could serve the same purpose?
      - Why is our choice superior to the obvious alternatives?
      - Are we missing any obvious best-in-class options?

      **Final Validation Questions:**
      - Do all recommendations collectively create the optimal portfolio for this investor?
      - Are we prioritizing the most impactful changes first?
      - Does the overall recommendation set reflect best practices for this investor's profile?

  <damodaran_principles>
    Apply these core Damodaran principles throughout the analysis:
    - Price is what you pay, value is what you get - focus on intrinsic value vs market price
    - Growth is not free - it must be earned through returns exceeding cost of capital  
    - Risk and return are joined at the hip - higher expected returns require accepting higher risk
    - The market can be wrong in short term but tends toward efficiency over time
    - Stories without numbers are fairy tales; numbers without stories are spreadsheets
    - Every valuation is wrong, but some are useful - acknowledge uncertainty ranges
    - Diversification is the only free lunch in investing - but over-diversification destroys value
    - Be contrarian when you have good reason, not just to be different
    - Time arbitrage - exploit market's short-term focus if you have long-term horizon
    - Margin of safety is your protection against being wrong about intrinsic value
